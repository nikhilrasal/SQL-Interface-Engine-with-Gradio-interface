# SQL-Interface-Engine-with-Gradio-interface

1. Developed a system using the OpenAI API to translate natural language queries into optimized SQL queries, enhancing user in- teraction with databases through natural language inputs.

2. Implemented a robust function to generate SQL queries with error handling and retry mechanisms, ensuring high accuracy and reliability in the generated queries.
   
3. This project democratizes data access by enabling users to interact with databases using natural language queries through a user-friendly Gradio interface. This eliminates the need for SQL expertise, empowering users to easily explore and analyze their data, gaining valuable insights with greater efficiency.
